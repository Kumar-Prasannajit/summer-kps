# 🌞 Summer-KPS

This repository is a collection of **43 days of continuous coding streaks** during my summer vacation.  
Instead of creating multiple repositories, I kept all the projects in one place — each day representing a new project, idea, or practice exercise.

🔗 **Live Demo (GitHub Pages):**  
Projects can be viewed at:  
For example:  
- [Day 1](https://kumar-prasannajit.github.io/summer-kps/day-1) → Navbar practice  
- [Day 4 - Cuberto](https://kumar-prasannajit.github.io/summer-kps/day4-Cuberto) → Animation effects with Shery.js
